A game created by me for the Extra Credits Game Jam #6 (August 24, 2020)

~~~~

This game was created over the course of 3 days (August 21 - August 24 2020) for the Extra Credits Game Jam #6. I used 
C# and the Unity game engine.

The theme of this jam was "Take Care", and I wanted to use it to explore an idea I had been bouncing around about a 
dog-sitting game, where you have to manage a group of rowdy dogs. The core fun would come from the chaos of simply not
having enough hands to take care of all the dogs at once. You have to juggle multiple activities in order to complete
the game without losing all the precious vases you need to protect.

This required me to create my first real interactible AI system. In retrospect, it was probably not a very good idea
to give myself less than a day to learn Finite State Machines, but I think it all worked out in the end. The code for the 
dogs may be messy, but it gives them needs they need satisfied, as well as distict states for roaming, seeking out treats,
and seeking out vases to knock over. Unfortunately, the time it took me to perfect this system made me unable to implement 
some of the other ideas I had for other interactible objects. 

There were 521 entries to the jam, but this game jam was not ranked. All art, sound, and code were created solely by me. 
In the game's files, there is code for other pre-made AI pathfinding systems, but they didn't work for the game I had in 
mind. The code that the dogs ultimately use is 100% my code.
